# BlueBox - A Text Adventure
Part old school telephony/PSTN/POST BlueBox tutorial, part text adventure. This adventure game doesn't have a text parser, it has a tone parser that should work with any real-world / software "bluebox". Learn how to Phone Phreak like it's 1979!

Implemented as just a simple web page (html/js) using WebAudio

To be debuted at the Retro Hands-On-Hacking village at BSides Leeds 2024
